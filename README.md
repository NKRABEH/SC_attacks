This repository contains my implentation for two side channel attacks as described in [1] and [2]. \
This work was part of my Hardware security course, I took at Eurecom During the spring semester 2019. \
Professor Renaud Pacalet supervised this work and provided the initial setup, cryptographic software libraries and the data generator needed to accomplish this project.

# Attacks 
* The [timing attack ]: implemented in C
* The [power attack ]:  implemented in Python
