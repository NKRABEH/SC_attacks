# Side channel attacks 
This repository contains my implentation for two side channel attacks as described in [1] and [2].
This work was part of my Hardware security course, I took at Eurecom During the spring semester 2019.
Professor Renaud Pacalet supervised this work and provided the initial setup, cryptographic software libraries and the data generator needed to accomplish this project.

# Attacks 
* The [timing attack ]: ./timingAttack
* The [power attack ]:  ./powerAttack


### Programming languages
The timing attack was implemented in C while the power attack was implemented in Python.
